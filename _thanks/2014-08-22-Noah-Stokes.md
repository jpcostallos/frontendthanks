I've attended a lot of conferences, very few have been the caliber of yours. When we chatted on the ride to and from the airport, aside from the Pearl Jam talk, it was great to hear how you very specifically pick your speakers for more than their knowledge but for their characteristics. Not many conference organizers would even consider to go to that length, but you do, and that's what makes you and your conferences specialâ€“you genuinely care. Thank you SO much for the way that you give back to our community. You will indeed be missed! Don't stay gone for too long...
