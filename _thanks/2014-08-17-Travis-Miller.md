Who would've thought Hip-hop and the Web would be a great topic at Front End Design Conference? Turns out I was lucky that Dan did. In most cases he turned out be a bigger Hip-hop enthusiast than me. More than I think he knows, Dan has been a great role model to me on and offline. Dan gave me a chance to speak on something I was passionate about for the first time in front my peers and for that I'll be forever grateful. Front End Design Conference on the whole has made me a better person in multiple aspects of my profession. I can't imagine where I'd be today without it.

I have no doubt that we're going to keep the spirit of the conference alive in one way or another (The Bahamas is still on the table haha).

I wish Dan, Cherrie and the entire family all the best. To many more years of moving the web forward!
