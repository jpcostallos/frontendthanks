2013 was my first Front-End Conf. Dan and Cherrie really made me feel like part of their family. Over the past year I've come to think of them not as colleagues but as friends. That's just how they treat everyone. The work they've put in hasn't just made a first class conference, but a really great, diverse community. It's been a real honor to be part of the conference in 2014, but more importantly the community I've joined continues to challenge me to improve my own skills. 

I can't say thank you enough to everyone involved, especially the attendees that have made me feel like we've been friends for years.
