Dan and Cherrie… what can I say? The first time I met Dan in the flesh, he was picking me up from my flight into Florida for Front-end Design Conf 2012. I was a scruffy Canadian with far too much clothing on for the weather and no clue where I was. If you know Dan, you know that his smile lights up a room and was one of the most welcoming sights a foreigner could ask.

I was extremely nervous, only having spoken at a few conferences at that time. I didn’t know if my content would translate well; Be long enough; Speak to the crowd; Or be useful. Quickly though, Dan and Cherrie made me feel right at home, easing all of my fears. They introduced me to other speakers and attendees; Many of which they considered close friends; And, who in turn, became my close friends. They went out of their ways to personalize your experience and make you feel apart of the tight-nit community they had created. 

To anyone who wasn’t able to attend one of these incredible conferences, I can tell you that you missed some amazing experiences; Filled with love, laughter and lots of learning. These events will be missed deeply. 

Thanks for everything you’ve done and are doing now and in the future Cherrie and Dan! You were and still are the ultimate tag-team. Next time, drinks are on me!

P.S. I want that faux-hawk card board caricature of me Dan!
