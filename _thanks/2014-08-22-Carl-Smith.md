I was first asked by Dan to speak at Frontend in 2012. I had no idea how much that event would change me personally. When I checked into my hotel room there was a gift box waiting for me. I opened it and found the complete collection of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit cartoons on DVD. To this day I don’t know how Dan and Cherrie figured out that I was an Oswald fanatic. At the speaker dinner that night I met Sarah Parmenter and asked her what her speaker gift was. She said she got a speaker box but there wasn’t anything specific in there for her. I asked what was in the box and she said. “Chocolates. coffee, Snyders pretzels…” I stopped her and asked why Snyders pretzels? She looked at me and said, “you didn’t get Snyders pretzels? They are the most amazing pretzels in the world and we can’t get them in England.” I told her that was her special gift and she looked puzzled. She went on to tell me that when she was a child she had a pen pal in the states who sent the pretzels to her and she fell in love with them. “But how would they know I loved them?”

That story sums up why Frontend Design Conference was so special. Because Dan and Cherrie cared about everyone enough to find out what mattered to them. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you Dan and Cherrie. You are amazing.
