Dan Denney never seems to ask for anything. He's always the giver, always finding out ways to help other people. The Front-end Design Conference in St. Pete, and the newly minted Portland edition, are clear examples of this.

I've been to all of the St. Pete conferences with the exception of one, and it's *the* conference that I look forward to every year.  I know that the speakers and attendees, as always, will be top-notch, and I'll be provided with the opportunity to meet an amazing group of people in the industry.

In addition to thanking Dan for everything, I want thank Cherrie Denney, and Dan's entire family, who work tirelessly each year to ensure that everything goes perfectly for the speakers and attendees. This year, I was fortunate enough to witness it first-hand by watching Dan make airport runs all day to pick up the speakers, while Cherrie ensured that everything was running smoothly, calmly fixing a share of issues along the way. It was at that moment that I realized it's no surprise they put on such a stellar conference each year.

I know that Dan will continue to support and grow the front-end and design community in a thousand other ways. That, I am absolutely sure of. This is no goodbye.
